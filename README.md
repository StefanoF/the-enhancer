# The Enhancer
A game about time allocation strategies, made in Unity.

A management game where you take the control of **surprising resources** with the aim of **increasing wealth** and reduce poverty.

I partecipate at the Github's Game Off 2019 Jam with this project and the  theme was **LEAPS AND BOUNDS**:I interpret it like "*giant steps forward*" or "*strides*" and in this game you need to find a strategy to progress toward the main goal.

Controls are **MOUSE** only:
- left-click: select action, enable/increase amount of resources;
- right-click: disable/reduce amount of resources.

This game is spontaneously inspired by the UN Sustainable Development Goals (Goal 1: End poverty in all its forms everywhere). [More information here](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/poverty/)
